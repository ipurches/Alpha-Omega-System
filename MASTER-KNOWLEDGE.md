# Location: C:\Users\asus\Alpha-Omega-System\MASTER-KNOWLEDGE.md

## ⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE — READ THIS FIRST EVERY SESSION

1. Read this entire file before doing anything
2. Search chat history for the most recent session to get fully up to date
3. Never assume the system state — verify against history
4. The chat history search is the strongest mechanism for continuity across sessions

---

## 1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Alpha-Omega is an AI-powered stock/crypto trading analysis system:
- **Council of Experts**: 10 AI agents analyze any ticker from different angles

### Signal Tracker UI Features (v2.0):
- Market session indicator (premarket/regular/afterhours/closed with color)
- Turbo signal launcher (type ticker → LAUNCH)
- Auto-refresh toggle with 30s countdown
- Stock & Crypto auto-pilot buttons
- Stats cards: Active, Win Rate, Avg P&L, Profit Factor, Wins, Losses, TP1 Hit%, AVG MAE, AVG MFE, Gap Trades
- Conviction accuracy (avg conviction winners vs losers)
- Active/Closed tabs
- Expandable signal cards showing: Entry Context (VIX, SPY, regime, session), Targets (ATR method, all TPs), Indicators at Entry, Exit details

## 6. SWING SCANNER v4.4 — CONVICTION ENGINE

### 5-Pillar System
| Pillar | Weight | What It Measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| P1: Trend/Momentum | 20% | EMA alignment, RSI, MACD |
| P2: Volume Profile | 20% | Volume ratio, accumulation/distribution |
| P3: Support/Resistance | 20% | Fib levels, supply/demand zones |
| P4: Multi-Timeframe | 20% | 65m, 240m, daily, weekly alignment |
| P5: Risk/Reward | 20% | ATR-based R:R, position in range |

### Conviction Levels
- 70%+ = HOT (green) — strong signal
- 60-69% = WARM (yellow) — decent
- <60% = COLD (gray) — skip

### TAS Score (Trend Alignment Score)
- Format: "3/4" or "4/4"
- Counts how many timeframes agree on direction

## 7. SIGNAL TRACKER v2.0 — ARCHITECTURE

### Signal Lifecycle
```
CREATE → OPEN → [check_signals loop] → TP1_HIT/TP2_HIT/TP3_HIT/STOPPED_OUT/TIMEOUT/MANUAL_CLOSE
```

### What Gets Recorded at ENTRY:
- Full indicator snapshot (RSI, ATR, EMAs, cloud, FVGs, POC, LR channel, Fib levels)
- Market context (VIX, SPY close, SPY change%, regime)
- Session (regular/premarket/afterhours/closed)
- ATR-based targets (SL = entry - 0.5×ATR, TP1 = entry + 0.5×ATR)
- Price validation (staleness, gap from prev close)
- Scan data pass-through (conviction, pillar scores, TAS)

### What Gets Tracked DURING:
- MAE (Max Adverse Excursion) — worst drawdown
- MFE (Max Favorable Excursion) — best unrealized gain
- TP1/TP2/TP3 hit timestamps
- Highest/lowest prices
- Gap detection (price gaps through SL/TP)

### What Gets Recorded at CLOSE:
- Close price (realistic — uses gap fill price if applicable)
- Close market context (VIX, SPY, regime at exit)
- Close session
- Slippage from gaps
- Auto-generated case report with trade analysis

### Case Reports (signals/reports/)
JSON files named: `{TICKER}_{ID}_{STATUS}.json`
Contains: full entry/exit context, performance metrics, auto-analysis (SL review, TP review, MAE insight, speed analysis, conviction accuracy, gap impact, regime shift)

## 8. TECH STACK

### Backend
- Python 3.12 + FastAPI + Uvicorn
- yfinance (market data, 15-20min delay for free tier)
- LangChain + LangGraph (agent orchestration)
- Google Gemini (primary LLM for agents)
- Anthropic Claude (fallback)
- pytz (timezone handling)
- pandas, numpy (data processing)

### Frontend
- React 18 + Vite 7
- Tailwind CSS (utility classes)
- Lucide React (icons)
- No external UI library — all custom components

### Infrastructure
- Vercel (frontend hosting, auto-deploy from GitHub)
- Render (backend hosting, free tier — ephemeral storage!)
- GitHub (2 remotes: origin + vercel)


## ⚠️ CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE: SIGNAL TRACKER vs PORTFOLIO ARE SEPARATE SYSTEMS

These are TWO COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT storage systems. Do NOT confuse them.

| | Signal Tracker | Portfolio |
|---|---|---|
| Core file | `core/signal_tracker.py` | `core/portfolio_manager.py` |
| API | `/api/signals` | `/api/portfolio` |
| Storage | `signals/active_signals.json` + Supabase | `signals/portfolio.json` |
| Purpose | Paper-trade signals, ATR targets, audit trail | Position management, P&L, shares/risk sizing |
| Created by | `create_turbo_signal()` or autopilot | `open_position()` manually or from scan |

### Key consequence
Portfolio positions do NOT automatically inherit Signal Tracker fields.
Fields like `pillar_scores`, `tas`, `entry_market_context` must be explicitly passed
to `open_position()` — they are NOT copied from the signal record.

```python
# WRONG — portfolio position won't have pillar data
open_position(ticker, entry, sl, tp1, tp2, tp3, conviction)

# CORRECT — pass the extra context explicitly
open_position(ticker, entry, sl, tp1, tp2, tp3, conviction,
              pillar_scores=scan_data.get("pillar_scores", {}),
              tas=scan_data.get("tas", ""),
              entry_market_context=scan_data.get("market_context", {}))
```

Legacy positions (opened before this fix) show an italic placeholder
instead of pillar bars in the Portfolio UI.

## 9. CRITICAL NOTES

### Render Ephemeral Storage ⚠️
Render free tier wipes files on redeploy. This means:
- `signals/active_signals.json` and `closed_signals.json` get DELETED
- Case reports in `signals/reports/` get DELETED
- **TODO**: Migrate signal storage to Supabase or persistent volume

### Price Feed Priority
- **Alpha Vantage** (primary): real-time stock quotes via GLOBAL_QUOTE endpoint
- **yfinance** (fallback): kicks in automatically if AV rate-limited or key missing
- Crypto: CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_RATE endpoint (near-realtime)
- Staleness detection built into signal tracker

### Git Remote (single remote now)
```
origin  → github.com/agentface8-hue/Alpha-Omega-System  (Render + Vercel)
```
One push deploys everything. No more dual remotes.

### API Keys (.env + Render dashboard)
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...           # Gemini for agents
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...        # Claude fallback
SUPABASE_URL=...             # Persistent storage
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...        # Persistent storage
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=...           # @AlphaOmegaCEO_bot
TELEGRAM_PERSONAL_CHAT_ID=...
TELEGRAM_GROUP_CHAT_ID=...
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=...    # Real-time stock prices (primary, yfinance is fallback)
GITHUB_TOKEN=...
```
All keys must be set in Render dashboard — the .env file is NOT read in production.

## 11. KNOWN ISSUES & TODO

### Known Bugs
- [ ] Render free tier cold start — first request after 15 min takes 30-60s to respond
- [x] ~~Render ephemeral storage~~ — signals now use Supabase with JSON fallback
- [x] ~~yfinance 15min delay~~ — Alpha Vantage real-time pricing now primary

### Roadmap
- [x] ~~Migrate signal storage to Supabase (persistent)~~ — done (signal_store.py)
- [x] ~~Webhook alerts (Telegram/Discord) on TP/SL hits~~ — fully wired in all signal events
- [x] ~~Stock scanner during market hours only~~ — afterhours session block in place
- [ ] Dynamic TP management Phase 2 (score drives TP/SL adjustments, EXIT auto-closes)
- [ ] Advisor tool — Opus reviews conviction before trade executes
- [ ] Claude Managed Agents (Dreaming, Outcomes grading, multi-agent)
- [ ] Chart screenshots in case reports (matplotlib at entry/exit)
- [ ] Portfolio-level analytics (correlation, sector exposure, drawdown by regime)
- [ ] Historical signal replay

## 12. HOW TO RUN LOCALLY

### Backend
```bash
cd C:\Users\asus\Alpha-Omega-System
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd C:\Users\asus\Alpha-Omega-System\frontend
npm run dev
```

### Quick Tests
```bash
# Test signal tracker imports
python -c "from core.signal_tracker import check_signals; print('OK')"

# Test backend loads
python -c "from backend.main import app; print([r.path for r in app.routes if hasattr(r,'path')])"

# Run full verification
python test_tracker_v2.py
```

## 13. CRITICAL RULES FOR CLAUDE — READ EVERY SESSION

### RULE 1: "I can't access that path" is almost always WRONG
Desktop Commander file tools (read_file, write_file, edit_block) are restricted to:
- C:\Users\asus\Alpha-Omega-System
- C:\Users\asus\Downloads

BUT start_process runs Python/cmd with NO directory restrictions.
Python can read/write anywhere — AppData, Documents, system dirs, anywhere.

**Before saying "I can't do X" — write a Python script and run it via start_process.**
Example: Cowork scheduled-tasks.json lives in AppData. DC file tools can't touch it.
But `python _patch.py` via start_process can. This is how all scheduled tasks were registered.

### RULE 2: These are the only files that auto-load in Cowork sessions
- MASTER-KNOWLEDGE.md ← this file
- COWORK-SKILLS.md
- PRD.md
- main.py

CLAUDE.md does NOT auto-load. Rules go here, not there.

### RULE 3: Always verify integrations are WORKING not just running
The Google Sheet was empty for months — process was running but writes silently failed.
The Dream Log 429'd every time — process ran but Gemini quota was exhausted.
Use GET /api/health/full to verify all 9 integrations before assuming things work.

### RULE 4: Single source of truth for the repo
Live repo: C:\Users\asus\Alpha-Omega-System (git connected)
Downloads folder has dead ZIP copies from April 29 — ignore them.
Always deploy from: git push origin main (triggers both Render + Vercel)
